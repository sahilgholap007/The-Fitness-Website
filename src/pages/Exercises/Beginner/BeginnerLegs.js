You know that you are performing the wall sit properly if you form a right angle (90 degrees) at your hips and your knees, your back is flat against the wall, and your heels are on the ground. You should be able to feel a slight pulling of the quad area. You can do this exercise as part of any lower body routine.</h4>

Lift your right leg up behind you and place the top of your foot on the bench. Your feet should still be about shoulder-width apart, and your right foot should be far enough in front of the bench where you can comfortably lunge — hop around a bit so you can find the right spot. If a closer foot position works, just ensure that when you lower down, your left knee doesn’t fall over the line of your toes.</h4>

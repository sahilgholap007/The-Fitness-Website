                            Press the weights above your chest by extending your elbows until your arms are straight, then bring the weights back down slowly.

                            Push torso back up by straightening arms. Slow and steady, baby.

                            Sit on the machine, grasp the handles and/or place your forearms on the padding. Take the weight off the stack slightly. This is the starting position for the exercise.
                            Keeping your body fixed, slowly bring the forearm pads or handles together. Don't let them touch.
                            Squeeze the chest muscles for a count of 1-3, then slowly lower back to the starting position.
                            Repeat for desired reps.

                            To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, and press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.
                            Slowly lower the dumbbells under control as far as comfortably possible (the handles should be about level with your chest).
                            Contract the chest and push the dumbbells back up to the starting position.
                            Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

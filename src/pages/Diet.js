                        <h4>While carbohydrates are often blamed for weight gain, theyâ€™re a necessary element of any healthy diet. Your body uses them as fuel to keep your brain and muscles functioning properly. MayoClinic.com recommends eating approximately 300 grams of carbohydrates daily on a 2,000-calorie diet. Eating a high-carbohydrate breakfast gives your body an early boost and helps you meet your nutritional goals for the day. Depending on your caloric and protein intake goals, add protein sources such as eggs or yogurt to a carb-focused breakfast to complete the meal.</h4>

                        <h4>People looking to lose weight often decide to adopt a high-protein diet. Eating protein helps a person feel full, which can lead to them eating fewer calories overall. High-protein diets typically include large quantities of protein and only a small amount of carbohydrate.

                        Most people can follow a high-protein diet by eating meat, fish, dairy products, beans and legumes, eggs, and vegetables that are relatively rich in protein, such as asparagus and spinach.

                        People on this diet will often choose to reduce their carbohydrate intake, which may involve limiting their consumption of highly processed foods, bread and other baked goods, candy, and white pasta and rice.

                        There are some well-known high-protein diet plans, such as the Atkins diet. However, a person can increase their protein intake on their own with or without adjusting their intake of other food groups.

                        In this article, we explain how to eat a high-protein diet, foods to include and exclude, and the potential adverse effects of adopting this diet. </h4>

                        <h4>The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low carb diets.

                            It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.

                            When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain (6Trusted Source).

                            Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits                            </h4>
